Used to detect the format of a fastq file. In its current state,
it can only differentiate between sanger and solexa/illumina.
If need arises, checking for different versions of illumina formats
could easily be implemented. ( Please upload an update if you implement this )
 
Can easily be copy/pasted into any other script and altered to do other
things than die when it has determined the format.
 
Pseudo code
 
* Open the fastq file
* Look at each quality ASCII char and convert it to a number
* Depending on if that number is above or below certain thresholds,
  determine the format.
